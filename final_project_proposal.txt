Team Member: SIXUAN CHEN, WENYU ZHANG

Dataset Description
Dataset Name: Online Retail Data Set
Dataset Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Dataset Information: This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
Attribute Information:
InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. 
StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product. 
Description: Product (item) name. Nominal. 
Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric. 
InvoiceDate: Invoice Date and time. Numeric.
UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling. 
CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer. 
Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

Dataset Preparation
Remove outliers
Separate attribute “InvoiceDate” into two new attribute describing transaction date and transaction time
Add new attribute named “TotalPrice” showing total amount of every distinct transaction
Add new attribute named “Frequency” showing shopping times of every distinct customer

Possible Algorithms
Clustering: based on customers’ shopping amount and frequency, cluster customers into 3 groups(VIP, normal customers and visitors) using k-means algorithm
Classification: given a customer, predict which cluster he/she belongs to using classification tree
Association Rule: based on transaction data, discover association rules among certain items in order to conduct product promotion
